# Add fractions and whole numbers
Kata from the course "The World's Best Intro to TDD, Level 1" (https://www.jbrains.ca/training/course/worlds-best-intro-to-tdd/).

Developed with dotnet (c#) and Visual Studio.

## Practice objectives
- TDD
- xUnit
- Simple Design
- Github Copilot (only for guessing new tests and some minor guesses for production code9

## Brief explanation
As a warm up, try adding some fractions.

With this exercise, you’ll start to establish the habit of writing the testfirst.

If you don’t know how to add fractions, then search the web for an explanation. Wikpedia will probably give youeverything you need.

You’ll build a library function that adds fractions as exact values—no converting to floating-pointnumbers! For example: 1/8 + 3/8  1/2. And that’s your first test!
